# Documentation Images

This directory should contain screenshots and GIFs demonstrating the project's functionality.

## Recommended Images to Add

1. **scheduler_running.png** - A screenshot of the task scheduler running in a terminal, showing log output of scheduled tasks
2. **scraper_output.png** - A screenshot showing the structured data extracted by the scraper
3. **data_processing.gif** - An animation showing the conversion between different data formats
4. **config_usage.png** - A screenshot demonstrating the configuration system in action

## How to Create Good Documentation Images

1. **Screenshots**:
   - Use a clean terminal with readable font size
   - Show real output with meaningful data
   - Highlight important sections with annotations if needed

2. **GIFs**:
   - Keep them short (< 30 seconds)
   - Focus on the key functionality
   - Add captions or annotations
   - Optimize file size
